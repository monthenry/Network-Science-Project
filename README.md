# Network Analysis of "MiBici" Public Bike Service in Guadalajara's Metropolitan Area

This repository contains the code and data for the network analysis of the public shared bike service known as "MiBici" in Guadalajara's metropolitan area (ZMG) in Jalisco, Mexico, from December 2014 to January 2024.

## Overview

The project aims to explore the network structure, dynamics, and user behaviors of the "MiBici" public bike service using network analysis techniques. It includes the following components:

- Data preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the raw data for analysis.
- Network construction: Building the network representation of the bike service system.
- Analysis scripts: Implementing various network analysis techniques to study the system's characteristics.
- Visualization: Creating visualizations to interpret and present the analysis results.
- Paper: Documenting the findings in a research paper.
