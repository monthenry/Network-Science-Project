# Network Analysis of 'MiBici' Public Bike Service in Guadalajara's Metropolitan Area

This repository contains a comprehensive network analysis of the public shared bike service known as "MiBici" in Guadalajara's metropolitan area (ZMG) in Jalisco, Mexico, spanning from December 2014 to January 2024. The analysis delves into the network structure, dynamics, and user behaviors of the "MiBici" system using advanced network analysis techniques. The findings contribute significantly to the understanding of public bike-sharing systems and offer valuable recommendations for improving service operations and urban planning efforts.
